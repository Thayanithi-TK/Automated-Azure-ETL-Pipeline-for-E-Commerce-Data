  Welcome to My **Automated Azure ETL Pipeline for E-Commerce Data**Project! this project design and implementation of an **Automated Azure ETL pipeline** using **ADF** and **Databricks** to process e-commerce data with incremental loading and **Star Schema* modeling.

# Overview
  This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** in **Microsoft Azure** for processing e-commerce sales data. The solution leverages **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** for orchestration, **Azure Databricks** for data transformation, and **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** for scalable data storage. An **incremental data loading mechanism**and **Star Schema**data model ensure optimized performance, scalability, and maintainability
