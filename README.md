# Automated Azure ETL Pipeline for E-Commerce Date using Star Schema

This project builds an automated **ETL pipeline** in **Azure** to process e-commerce sales data efficiently. Using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, the pipeline orchestrates and schedules data movement with **incremental loading** to ensure only new or updated records are processed. **Azure Databricks** handles complex data transformations and loads the refined data into a **Star Schema** structure for optimized storage and analysis. The fully **automated workflow**.
